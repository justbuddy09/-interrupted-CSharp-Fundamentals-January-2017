enum - examples

By default, the first enumerator has the value 0, and the value of each successive enumerator is increased by 1. 
For example, in the following enumeration, Sat is 0, Sun is 1, Mon is 2, and so forth.

enum Days {Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri};  

Enumerators can use initializers to override the default values, as shown in the following example.

enum Days {Sat=1, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri};

struct - examples

A struct type is a value type that is typically used to encapsulate small groups of related variables, such as the coordinates of a rectangle or the characteristics of an item in an inventory. The following example shows a simple struct declaration:

public struct Book  
{  
    public decimal price;  
    public string title;  
    public string author;  
}
